          answer:

          question:
            '<p><strong>How is a Combi boiler different to other boiler types ?</strong></p>',
          answer:
            '<p>There are three types of boilers – regular, system and combination:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Regular boilers rely on a cold-water storage tank in the loft –&nbsp;water is heated by the boiler and then pumped to the heating circuit and a hot water cylinder, where it’s stored ready for you to use.</li><li>System boilers do away for the need of a feed and expansion tank as the system boiler has an expansion vessel within the boiler. Water is heated in the same way as a regular boiler and distributed to the heating circuit and hot water cylinder which is often found in an airing cupboard.</li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Combi boilers do not have a tank or cylinder; they heat radiators as normal but the hot water is on demand i.e. when you switch your tap on.﻿</span></li></ul>',
